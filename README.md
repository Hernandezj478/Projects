# üß† C++ Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **C++ Projects Portfolio**, a curated collection of applications and algorithms developed through coursework and independent exploration.  
These projects highlight my skills in **modern C++**, **object-oriented programming**, and **software design**, as well as my ability to create functional, optimized, and well-documented systems.

Each project demonstrates progressive learning - from implementing core data structures to designing full interactive applications and simulations.

## üöÄ Building and Running

Most projects can be built using Visual Studio or any C++17-compatible compiler.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Visual Studio
1. Open the `.sln` file inside the project folder.
2. Build and run (F5).

### üíª Manual (CMake or g++)
```bash
# Example using g++
cd CPP_Projects/Best_AVL
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 *.cpp -o BestAVL
./BestAVL
